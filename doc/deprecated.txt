mysql2oracle-schema.php & mysql2oracle-data.php
===============================================

These scripts are deprecated as of eZ Oracle 2.3.0. They are incompatible with some oracle specific
settings, and won't be maintained anymore. Alternatives can be found in the INSTALL file when it
comes to migrating from MySQL to Oracle.
